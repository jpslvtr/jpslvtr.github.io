                    Arrival Prediction System. Developed predictive models for Saqr Port in Ras Al Khaimah using AIS
                    data to improve arrival time predictions. Implemented linear regression, regression trees, and
                    random forest models to analyze arrival patterns across 904 unique vessels. The project aimed to
                    reduce $20,000/hour demurrage fees through better resource allocation.

                    a DNS spoofing tool that hijacks HTTP connections through a three-stage attack: ARP spoofing, DNS
                    response manipulation, and HTTP request interception. Developed using gopacket for packet
