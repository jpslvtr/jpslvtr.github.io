		<h3>James Park</h3><br>

		<h1>Professional</h1>
		<br><br>
		I'm currently pursuing my MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of 
		Business. I previously served as an Intelligence Officer in the US Navy 
		Cryptologic Warfare Community. Before that, I earned my BS in Computer 
		Science from the Naval Academy.
		<br><br>
		My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpslvtr/">
		LinkedIn</a> 
		and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jpslvtr/">Github</a>.
		<br><br>
		<h1>Personal</h1>
		<br><br>
		I like to categorize my hobbies according to Cal Newport's 
		<a target="_blank" 
		href="https://calnewport.com/the-deep-life-some-notes/">buckets of the 
		deep life</a>.
		<br><br>
		Craft: Beyond the professional, I'm interested in information 
		theory, cryptology, and natural language processing. I also like 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://jpslvtr.substack.com/">writing</a>.
		Constitution: For many years, I ran ultramarathons to satisfy my 
		addictive personality. Currently, I'm trying to figure out my 
		relationship with fitness. 
		Contemplation: Besides running, I spend most of my time <a target="_blank"

		I'm also almost always grappling with an existential problem.
