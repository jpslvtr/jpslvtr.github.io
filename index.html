		<h1>Professional</h1>
		<br><br>
		I'm currently pursing my MBA at Stanford GSB and working on a startup.
		<br><br>
		Previously I served as an Intelligence Officer in the US Navy 
		Cryptologic Warfare Community; studied computer science at the US Naval 
		Academy; and interned at a defense contractor, national lab, and federal 
		agency.
		<br><br>
		My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpark22/">
		LinkedIn</a> 
		and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jprd96/">Github</a>.
		<br><br>
		<h1>Personal</h1>
		<br><br>
		I like to categorize my hobbies according to Cal Newport's 
		<a target="_blank" 
		href="https://calnewport.com/the-deep-life-some-notes/">buckets of the 
		deep life</a>.
		<br><br>
		Craft: Beyond the professional realm, I'm interested in information 
		theory, cryptology, and digital ethics.
		<br><br>
		Constitution: To keep my addictive personality at bay, I run ultras. 
		Running keeps me on a natural high, leaving less room for other vices. 
		<br><br>
		Contemplation: If I'm not running, I'm probably <a target="_blank" 
		href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/38279114">reading</a> 
		or <a target="_blank" 
		href="https://undergroundcontrarian.substack.com/">writing</a>. I 
		particularly enjoy the philosophy of science.
		<br><br>
		Scuba diving is my random expensive hobby. During the early days of 
		COVID, I qualified as a PADI rescue diver.
		<br><br>
		People I look up to: Cal Newport, Claude Shannon, Jonny Kim, Peter 
		Thiel, Benjamin Franklin, Ren√© Girard, Al Gore, Jocko Willink, and David 
		Goggins.
