			<h1>Start Here</h1>
			<p>
				I'm currently pursuing my MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Previously, I served as a cryptologist and intelligence officer in the US Navy. Before that, I earned my BS from the US
				Naval Academy, where I studied Computer Science.
				<br><br>
				I try to lead a <a href="https://calnewport.com/the-deep-life-some-notes/" target="_blank">deep life</a> and organize my pursuits into four buckets: craft (work and quality leisure), community (family, friends), contemplation (matters of the soul), and constitution (health). My craft bucket largely falls into two categories: tech for national security and exploring ways to create more meaningful social media.
