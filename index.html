		<h1>Professional</h1>
		<br><br>
		I'm currently pursuing my MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I previously served as a cryptologist and intelligence officer in the US Navy. Before that, I earned my BS from the US Naval Academy, where I studied Computer Science.

		My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpslvtr/">

		<h1>Personal</h1>
		<br><br>
		I like to categorize my hobbies according to Cal Newport's 
		<a target="_blank" 
		href="https://calnewport.com/the-deep-life-some-notes/">buckets of the 
		deep life</a>.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Craft: beyond the professional, I'm interested in information theory, cryptology, and natural language processing. I also like 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://jpslvtr.substack.com/">writing</a>.		
			</li>
			<li>
				Constitution: for many years, I ran ultramarathons to satisfy my addictive personality. Currently, I'm trying to figure out my relationship with fitness. Contemplation: besides running, I spend most 
				of my time <a target="_blank" 
				href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/38279114">reading</a>. 		
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm also always either working on a side project or grappling with an existential problem.
