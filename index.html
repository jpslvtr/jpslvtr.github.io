		<h1>Professional</h1>
		<br><br>
		I'm currently pursing my MBA at Stanford GSB and working on a startup.
		<br><br>
		Previously I served as an Intelligence Officer in the US Navy 
		Cryptologic Warfare Community; studied CS at the US Naval Academy; and 
		interned at a defense contractor, national lab, and federal agency.
		<br><br>
		My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpark22/">
		LinkedIn</a> 
		and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jprd96/">Github</a>.
		<br><br>
		<h1>Personal</h1>
		<br><br>
		I run ultras because I have an addictive personality. Running keeps me 
		on a natural high, leaving no room for other vices.
		I also like to <a target="_blank" 
		href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/38279114">read</a> 
		and <a target="_blank" 
		href="https://undergroundcontrarian.substack.com/">write</a>. My 
		expensive hobby is scuba diving. During the early days of COVID, I 
		became a qualified PADI rescue diver.
		<br><br>
		Intellectually, I'm interested in information theory, integrated 
		information theory, and cryptology.
		<br><br>
		People I look up to: Cal Newport, Jocko Willink, and Ren√© Girard.
