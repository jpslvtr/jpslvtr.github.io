                    “But depression wasn’t the word. This was a plunge encompassing sorrow and revulsion far beyond the personal: a sick,
                    drenching nausea at all humanity and human endeavor from the dawn of time. The writhing loathsomeness of the biological
                    order. Old age, sickness, death. No escape for anyone. Even the beautiful ones were like soft fruit about to spoil. And
                    yet somehow people still kept fucking and breeding and popping out new fodder for the grave, producing more and more new
                    beings to suffer like this was some kind of redemptive, or good, or even somehow morally admirable thing: dragging more
                    innocent creatures into the lose-lose game. Squirming babies and plodding, complacent, hormone-drugged moms. Oh, isn’t
                    he cute? Awww. Kids shouting and skidding in the playground with no idea what future Hells awaited them: boring jobs and
                    ruinous mortgages and bad marriages and hair loss and hip replacements and lonely cups of coffee in an empty house and a
                    colostomy bag at the hospital. Most people seemed satisfied with the thin decorative glaze and the artful stage lighting
                    that, sometimes, made the bedrock atrocity of the human predicament look somewhat more mysterious or less abhorrent.
                    People gambled and golfed and planted gardens and traded stocks and had sex and bought new cars and practiced yoga and
                    worked and prayed and redecorated their homes and got worked up over the news and fussed over their children and
                    gossiped about their neighbors and pored over restaurant reviews and founded charitable organizations and supported
                    political candidates and attended the U.S. Open and dined and travelled and distracted themselves with all kinds of
                    gadgets and devices, flooding themselves incessantly with information and texts and communication and entertainment from
                    every direction to try to make themselves forget it: where we were, what we were. But in a strong light there was no
                    good spin you could put on it. It was rotten top to bottom. Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your
                    two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned
                    peaches at the nursing home. It was better never to have been born—never to have wanted anything, never to have hoped
                    for anything.”
                    <br><br>
                    When I read this, I had to put my Kindle down and stare at the blank screen on the seat in front of me. How had the
                    author so eloquently captured the spasms of dread that have hit me over the years? There's discomfort in not knowing
                    what how you feel looks like in writing. But now that I see it (and perhaps more so because someone else wrote it), I
                    feel this sense of relief. Life is suffering, and it may have been easier to have never been born, but easier compared
                    to what? Is non-existence a fair comparison? It seems wrong to compare nothing to something, even if that something
                    really sucks. Nothing seems easier than something. But that's also hard to wrap my mind around. Somehow, the challenge
                    of addressing these [explicit] questions gives me a perverse sense of peace.
                    <br><br>
                    We get by by assuming that something is better than nothing, or we choose to bury ourselves in work, community, or
                    whatever else, and not think too hard about it all. Please excuse me as I hop on my next flight and keep myself busy.
