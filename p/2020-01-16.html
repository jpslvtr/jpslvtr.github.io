                <h1>Social Media</h1>
                <p><i>Jan 16, 2020</i></p>
                <p>
                    I live in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The city is rich with American history. Its buildings boast neoclassical architecture - it holds members of all three branches of government, national monuments, and museums; and
                    is home to more than a hundred foreign embassies. It also has fourteen national parks, to include Rock Creek Park (over twice the size of NY's Central Park). As a runner I fell in love with Rock Creeks' trails the moment I saw them online.
                    <br><br>
                    I was on the metro a few days ago. It was around 5pm and the sun was setting. I looked out the window. The colors outside were magical. Daylight transitions into dusk at sunset, but there's a moment of beauty that is fleeting - when
                    dusk transitions to twilight. I wanted to make sure I caught this moment.
                    <br><br>
                    I looked around. There was nothing particularly different about this metro ride. People around me were on their phones, occupied with whatever was on their screen. They could've been looking at an Instagram feed, swiping through a promotional email, or an assortment of other things. I went to reach for my phone but was met with an uneasy feeling in my stomach.
                    <br><br>
                    I straightened my back and took a deep breath. I looked at the people around me in the metro. These people missed the sunset because they were preoccupied with their phones.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not a fan of social media, and I don’t think that’s such a fringe opinion anymore. So many people are depressed, particularly those that grew up with social media. There are enough studies that prove this. There has been a sharp rise in depression amongst teens, college students, and millennials. The people in these demographics are constantly operating at an ambient level of anxiety. I have an eighteen-year old sister who shows this to be true. Social media
                    negatively affects their mental health and decreases their ability to do or even know to do the things they want to do.
                    <br><br>
                    Instagram has a user base of over one billion people. Over 60% of those users are females under the age of 34. This is not coincidental. If the perfect female bodies portrayed on Vogue magazines were bad for female self-esteem, then surely having the most attractive people portray the best versions of themselves all in one app would have a similar if not worse effect on the same demographic. What happens if a teenage girl posts a photo of herself? You don't have to be a
                    genius to see who gets more likes. Talk about killing self-esteem.
                    <br><br>
                    Social media is also ruining our attention span. Companies like Facebook and Twitter base their business models off of figuring out how to exploit end-user attention. More attention leads to more time spent on app, which ultimately leads
                    to advertisement companies able to promote more frequently. How do these companies do this? They hire engineers and social scientists to figure out how to manipulate basic human emotions. That slot-machine like effect that happens every
                    time you refresh your Twitter newsfeed? That's intentional. The recommendation algorithms that lead teenage girls looking up dieting videos to anecdotes on anorexia? An unfortunate side effect.
                    <br><br>
                    Edward Wilson, a famous biologist, is famous for saying something that I believe appropriately describes our relationship with the online landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    "The real problem of humanity is the following: we have paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions; and god-like technology."
                    <br><br>
                    It isn't a stretch to say that these giant Silicon Valley tech companies are skirting the rules of our medieval institutions and taking advantage of our basic human attention spans that need to be validated.
                    <br><br>
                    I recently listened to a podcast about our relationships with these companies and the balance of power. What stuck out to me was the side-stepping these companies are doing by not taking responsibility for their actions, yet reaping the monetary benefits. This comes down to fiduciary duty, which is a way the law in the U.S. makes sense of relationships where one party has asymmetric power over another.
                    <br><br>
                    Constitutional law describes relationships between individuals and the federal government. Legislative law or contractual law defines relationships between individuals and each other in society. And lastly, fiduciary law is
                    between lawyers and clients and doctors and patients. This has to do with protecting the asymmetry of power. For instance, a lawyer isn't allowed to turn on their client and say "I'm going to use this sensitive information you gave
                    me and sell it to the other side because I'll make more money that way". Fiduciary law protects clients from situations like that from happening. The key aspect determining the asymmetry of power is the amount of information the service
                    collects on their client that could be used to compromise the integrity of that client. The degree of that compromising information is the degree to which the relationship should not be equal contract.
                    <br><br>
                    The biggest lie that these Silicon Valley tech companies preach is that they are in an equal parties relationship with their user. You joined the app. You clicked the link. You scrolled to that video. What is unsaid is the entire workforce
                    of engineers behind the screen, creating a virtual you and continuously learning what will keep "you" scrolling. Factor in applications of AI research, and these companies know you better than you know yourself, which is an unprecedented
                    level of power imbalance.
                    <br><br>
                    These companies are going to defend themselves and say that humans are free agents and if users don't like the service the company provides, they are free to stop. They are going to push the agenda that what exists is an equal contract
                    relationship.
                    <br><br>
                    These companies didn't start with a diabolical plan to make robots of humans. No, these nerds slow-walked into their power. But with great power comes great responsibility. The government must push to have these companies switch to a
                    fiduciary model. This is a challenge, in part because the ill-gotten profits that these companies earn by "breaching their duties" is not just money, it's attention span. Our brightest minds have gotten us into this mess. Now they need
                    to get us out.
