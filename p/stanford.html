                    (In no particular order)
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GSBGEN 312: I'm Just a Bill</b>
                    <br>
                    A GSB class known for being controversial and challenging. It was essentially a legislative simulation. The most demanding course I’ve taken in my life but also the one I learned the most from. <i>Taught by: Keith Hennessey.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GSBGEN 346: Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism</b>
                    <br>
                    Another one from Keith. He loves stirring the pot. No professor challenges us to think as critically about the world as he does. <i>Taught by: Keith Hennessey.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CS 155: Computer and Network Security</b>
                    <br>
                    An introduction to the applications of cryptography. It covered control hijacking, isolation and sandboxing, OS and processor security, web attacks/defenses, application security, network protocols and attacks/defenses, and more. Not a GSB class, but based on content alone, it was my favorite class I've ever taken. <i>Taught by: Dan Boneh, Zakir Durumeric.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>MKTG 535: Product Launch</b>
                    <br>
                    For aspiring entrepreneurs. The class was intense, with lots of cold-calling, but incredibly insightful. Each class had founders or investors from the case come speak with us. One of the few classes where I felt compelled to take real notes. <i>Taught by: Jonathan Levav, Russell Siegelman.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CS 224G: Apps With LLMs Inside</b>
                    <br>
                    A very hands-on, project-based class with little admin. Taught by two serial founders who are also adjunct lecturers, the course focused on learning the latest tech and practical implementation. I was fortunate to be part of its inaugural cohort. <i>Taught by: Jan Jannink, John Whaley.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CEE 216: Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital</b>
                    <br>
                    Weekly seminars featuring heavy hitting founders and VCs like Jerry Yang (Yahoo), Mark Pincus (Zynga), and Eddie Kim (Gusto). A mix of grad students and undergrads made for great  conversation. <i>Taught by: Ernestine Fu, David Hornik.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>POLECON 342: Finding Religious and Spiritual Meaning at Work</b>
                    <br>
                    We basically read stuff and had deep discussions on that stuff. Scotty is the only GSB professor who dares to talk about spirituality. I can't speak for every student, but I definitely appreciate him for it. <i>Taught by: Scotty McLennan.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>APPPHYS 363: Modern Physics & Literature</b>
                    <br>
                    A hidden gem of a class that is jointly taught by the Physics & English departments. Topics included time, causality, higher dimensions, and quantum ontology. Read works by Rovelli, Bergson, Ken Liu, and Liu Cixin, including <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> series. Physics PhDs in the class helped the rest of us follow along. <i>Taught by: Hideo Mabuchi.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>STRAMGT 354: Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital</b>
                    <br>
                    A popular GSB class that usually requires a "super round" - using one of your two golden ticket cards for high-demand electives - to enroll. The course was mostly guest lectures and a business plan competition with a team. We had many incredible founder and investor guests. It’s one of those classes that made sitting in the classroom feel surreal. <i>Taught by: Scott Kupor, Eric Schmidt, Peter Wendell, Raymond Nasr.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>OB 388: Leadership in the Entertainment Industry</b>
                    <br>
                    While at Stanford I worked on a startup idea in the entertainment industry. That didn’t turn into anything, but I was able to quench my newfound interest in entertainment by taking this class. Every week we had guest speakers from the very top of the industry - Miky Lee (CJ Group – Parasite, Oldboy), Gwyneth Paltrow (actress and Goop CEO), Nina Jacobson (The Hunger Games, Crazy Rich Asians, The Goldfinch), Steve Stark (Wednesday, Fargo), Lisa Joy (Westworld), and so many more. It was an amazing privilege to take this class. <i>Taught by: Bill Guttentag.</i>
