                <p>
                    Some of my favorite classes at Stanford in roughly the order I took them:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>MKTG 535: Product Launch</b>
                    <br>
                    Essential for aspiring entrepreneurs. The class was intense, with lots of cold-calling, but incredibly insightful. Each
                    case discussion had founders or investors from the case come speak with the class. One of the few classes where I felt
                    compelled to take real notes. <i>Taught by: Jonathan Levav, Russell Siegelman.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CS 224G: Apps With LLMs Inside</b>
                    <br>
                    A hands-on, project-based class with very little admin. Taught by two serial founders who are also Stanford CS PhDs, the
                    course focused on learning the latest tech and practical implementation. I was fortunate to be part of its inaugural
                    cohort. <i>Taught by: Jan Jannink, John Whaley.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CEE 216: Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital</b>
                    <br>
                    Weekly seminars featuring founders and VCs, including
                    Jerry Yang (Yahoo), Mark Pincus (Zynga), and Eddie Kim (Gusto). A mix of grad students and undergrads made for great
                    conversation. <i>Taught by: Ernestine Fu, David Hornik.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>POLECON 549: The Business World - Moral & Spiritual Inquiry Through Literature</b>
                    <br>
                    We basically read a book each week and had deep discussions on them. Scotty is the only GSB professor who dares to talk
                    about spirituality. I can't speak for every student, but I definitely appreciate him for it. <i>Taught by: Scotty
                        McLennan.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>APPPHYS 363: Modern Physics & Literature</b>
                    <br>
                    A hidden gem of a class that is jointly taught by the Physics & English departments. Topics included time, causality,
                    higher dimensions, and quantum ontology. Read works by Rovelli, Bergson, Ken Liu, and Liu Cixin, including <i>The
                        Three-Body Problem</i> series. Physics PhDs in the class helped the rest of us follow along. <i>Taught by: Hideo
                        Mabuchi.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GSBGEN 312: I'm Just a Bill</b>
                    <br>
                    A notorious GSB class known for being controversial and challenging. It was essentially a legislative simulation. The
                    most demanding course I’ve taken but also the one I learned the most from. <i>Taught by: Keith Hennessey.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GSBGEN 346: Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism</b>
                    <br>
                    Another one from Keith. I think his goal is to reduce the number of morally inept business leaders the GSB produces. No
                    one else challenges us to think as critically about the world as he does. <i>Taught by: Keith Hennessey.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>STRAMGT 354: Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital</b>
                    <br>
                    A popular GSB class that usually requires a "super round" - using one of your two golden ticket cards for high-demand
                    electives - to enroll. The course was mostly guest lectures and a business plan competition with a team. We had many
                    incredible founder and investor guests. It’s one of those classes that made sitting in the classroom feel surreal.
                    <i>Taught by: Scott Kupor, Eric Schmidt, Peter Wendell, Raymond Nasr.</i>
