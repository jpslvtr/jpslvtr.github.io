                <h1>Business Ethics or Just Ethics?</h1>
                <p><i>Jun 01, 2024</i></p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently taking a class on compensation, and we're almost done with the quarter. One of our  recent classes was
                    on ESG, gender, and race. For the uninitiated (like me), ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It's a
                    set of criteria used to evaluate a company's operations and performance in terms of sustainability and ethical impact.
                    We started off the class talking about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html" target="_blank">Milton Friedman's hit piece in the NYT in 1970</a>, where he argued that the social
                    responsibility of any business is to maximize profits, not to promote social good, have a diverse set of employees, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that all behavior, both conscious and unconscious, is rooted in wanting to be in alignment with how we
                    understand reality. We treat our friends the way we treat them and choose the professions we choose because, inherently,
                    those behaviors align with how we want to show up in our understanding of reality. Stem cell researchers get into their
                    field to investigate the fundamental building blocks of life, seeking answers to questions about the essence of
                    existence. Quantum physicists aim to understand the nature of reality by studying tiny particles and forces in the
                    universe. Historians examine change, seeking to understand the essence of human existence and the forces that shape our
                    world. So, in a business school class on compensation, we're not really debating the social responsibilities of a
                    company. We're debating how we understand the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Back to the class. The professor had us take anonymous surveys, and we found that the class was divided on the topic of
                    whether the social responsibilities of a company were solely profit or something else. I'm going to be crude and collapse the
                    argument that companies should focus only on profit as the "right" and the argument that companies have responsibilities
                    towards ESG, gender, and race, as the "left."
                    <br><br>
                    A classmate on the right, we'll call him Bob,  defended his position by saying that ethics is always going to be gray as there will always be a winner and a loser, so agents (companies) don't have any business trying to be
                    ethical. That's why we have institutions like the government to give us laws to cooperate in our society. A classmate on
                    the left, we'll call her Alice, gave the example of "big sugar." If the sugar industry were driven purely by profit,
                    their sole focus would be on how to market an addictive product to a vulnerable population, knowing theyâ€™re contributing
                    to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other health issues.
                    <br><br>
                    It's funny; my childhood was spent on the left, my teen and young adult years were spent vehemently on the right, and
                    now I don't know where I stand. I see where both Bob and Alice are coming from, but I can also rip their
                    arguments apart.
                    <br><br>
                    Bob - I agree that reality is zero sum. It might be possible to set ethical norms in a small setting like a
                    family or amongst friends, but it's pretty much impossible with larger organizations and subsequent sets of those
                    organizations. We've agreed on a social contract that the government will guide us through laws and regulations. But do
                    you really plan on abiding by those laws? Isn't it the case that you try to pay the least amount of taxes possible? You
                    have no incentive to be any more moral than the most moral criminal and the least moral citizen. You may say you abide
                    by the government's laws, but really you undermine it. So when you say you'll abide by the ethical norms
                    set by the government, what I'm hearing is that <i>you're just offloading moral responsibility to another entity - an entity
                    you plan on undermining.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Alice - I despise big sugar. And large social media companies. They thrive on exploiting our psychologies. We're
                    getting closer to a world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk/" target="_blank">Wall-E</a> with each waking moment. But companies like Pfizer and Moderna, as despicable as the
                    pharmaceutical industry is, developed COVID-19 vaccines rapidly in response to the pandemic. Their prior pursuit of
                    profit resulted in vaccines that saved millions of lives. Amazon has arguably the most efficient logistics and
                    distribution systems in the world. By focusing on profit, they've created a world in which consumers have two-day access
                    to goods, while creating jobs in the process. <i>Is it not the case that the world we live in today is better than it used to be?</i> Lifespans have increased dramatically
                    and access to education has expanded to millions more people globally. These advancements are, in part, driven by
                    profit-seeking enterprises that innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible.
                    <br><br>
                    My take is that, yes, companies have a huge responsibility to maximize profits. They are  backed by shareholders
                    who have taken the risk to invest their own wealth. Companies exist to make money. But I
                    would place profit maximization as priority #2. Priority #1 would be something along the lines of trying to be a good
                    team player. And I don't just apply this standard to companies - I apply it to us as individuals. Before every decision we
                    make, we should question if what we're doing is good.
                    <br><br>
                    That is much easier said than done. "Good" is a  hazy word. And sometimes, to achieve a greater good, some ambiguous sacrifices must be
                    made. That's why I feel empathy for both Bob and Alice. Morality is hard to navigate, and at some point, you need to
                    draw a line in the sand to move forward. They are both motivated by a desire to see society function well and improve.
                    They hold healthy skepticism towards simplistic solutions. Bob doubts the feasibility of businesses enforcing their own
                    ethical standards uniformly, while Alice doubts that a profit-maximizing company can be an ethical agent.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm going to end this post in an unsatisfying way and not offer a solution because I don't think I have any good
                    ones. My only recommendation is that we try to be better people, however we define better.
