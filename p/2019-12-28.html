                    Newtonian physics describes what happens in systems that have large masses and slow speeds. There are three relevant limits that are good indicators that Newtonian physics is no longer the preferred model:
                    <br><br>
                    1. If the ratio v/c (where v is the speed of your system and c is the speed of light) is no longer close to zero, you need special relativity (Einstein).
                    <br><br>
                    2. If the ratio (2GM)/(c^2)(R) (where M is the mass, G is the gravitational constant, and R is the distance) is no longer close to zero, you need general relativity (Einstein).
                    <br><br>
                    3. If the ratio h/(pR) (where p is the momentum, h is the Planck constant, and R is the distance) is no longer close to zero, you need quantum mechanics (Bohr, Planck, Einstein).
                    <br><br>
                    The models mentioned above are unified. For example, the model of special relativity could be used to solve all solvable problems in physics, but it would just make the calculations unnecessarily difficult. Also, general relativity and quantum mechanics are the two major (but separate) theories for how the universe works. They work well in their own domain, but they are incompatible, especially when gravity is introduced. String Theory has been the only promising candidate of reconciling the two.
                    <br><br>
                    In Newtonian physics, systems are reversible. Physical processes hold unitarity, which is the condition that the time evolution of a state is mathematically represented by a unitary operator. In this model, there is implicit determinism.
                    Reversibility implies there is a correspondence between a past and present state, thus given complete knowledge of the current state, we should be able to predict all future states of the universe a la Laplace's demon.
                    <br><br>
                    Systems are not as easily reversible in quantum mechanics thanks to the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic outcome of measurement. It’s a contentious topic when the system is moving fast and/or when gravity is introduced. I don't want to explore this rabbit hole. The takeaway is that in Newtonian physics, the world is deterministic, implying there is no freedom vis-a-vis natural laws. But in other more involved models of the universe, the world is not deterministic, implying free will.
                    <br><br>
                    Leonard Susskind is a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University and is one of the leading minds in string theory and quantum mechanics. Here he talks about the indestructibleness of information. The conservation of the information principle makes sense, but Susskind's explanation and this response suggests that the principle is a
                    consequence of unitarity. Here is where I start to get stumped. Is information only relevant in Newtonian physics?
                    <br><br>
                    Noether's theorem is a beautiful fundamental theorem of calculus that connects symmetries to conserved quantities. When physics is independent of spatial position, momentum is conserved. When physics is independent of time, energy is
                    conserved. When you take quantum mechanics into account, Noether's theorem explicitly depends on unitarity. This theorem conserves quantities in nature across every known model of the universe.
                    <br><br>
                    If information is indeed indestructible, it would seem that the conservation of information is caused by the unitarity of the physical process from which the information came from. This is only compatible with Newtonian physics as
                    explained earlier. But I don’t see how this holds true when you consider that information exists on every scale. To explain my confusion, I need to bring in James Maxwell.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1867, Maxwell proposed a thought experiment called Maxwell's demon. If you pour hot liquid into a system of cold liquid, the resultant mix would have an average temperature of both liquids. The only way to stop that would be if there was a small demon there to stop this from happening. Absent this demon, the second law of thermodynamics states that the liquids will mix and reach an average temperature. Leo Szilard, a colleague of Einstein, noted that for the demon to be able to do this, he'd need to have information about which molecules are hot and which molecules are cold. That way he
                    could keep the liquids separated and they wouldn't reach an average temperature. This means there is just as much information as there is energy in the system.
                    <br><br>
                    Information and energy are two sides of the same coin. The laws of thermodynamics express facts about temperature, heat, and entropy from the subatomic to cosmic level. Information exists on these scales as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Susskind's belief about the conservation of information implies that information exists in the deterministic landscape underwritten by Newtonian physics. This is clearly not the case. Information exists beyond Newtonian physics if you
                    agree with Szilard, which I do.
                    <br><br>
                    Einstein's physics and quantum mechanics support an indeterminate nature of the universe, implying free will. But it seems that our current understanding of the information landscape doesn't support that claim.
                    <br><br>
                    From particle accelerators to high performance supercomputers, the physics of energy has achieved wonderful feats for mankind. It is governed by mathematical models that describe the universe well independently, but aren’t reconcilable with each other when gravity is introduced. I have a not-entirely-unsubstantiated suspicion that the disconnect has to do with the physics of information. There is so much undiscovered about information creation, symmetry, and measurement. Perhaps when we have clearer models on the physics of information and have revisited our current theories, will we
                    understand more about free will about our place in the universe.
