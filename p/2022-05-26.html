                    I’m not a gun enthusiast. I didn’t grow up playing Call of Duty. But I also don’t think guns kill people. I think the
                    reason for mass shootings stems from the entitled American mind.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re in Asia and you loathe women because they won’t date you, you end up sad and lonely. If the same happens in
                    America, you post an angry video on Youtube and murder sorority girls who won’t date you (Elliot Rodger).
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re in Europe and you don’t like people who don’t look like you, you avoid them. If the same happens here, you
                    write a <a href="https://link.us1.storjshare.io/s/juy2s3hvuc6osvo54wfdkaugymba/manifesto/Payton-Gendron-Manifesto.pdf" target="_blank">180 page manifesto</a> about why it’s imperative that Black and Jewish people die so that White people can stay in
                    power, and then you embark on a killing spree (Payton Gendron).
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re anywhere not in America, and you are not mentally in the right spot, the people around you help you. In the
                    absolute worst case, you may kill yourself. And that is terrible. But if the same happens here, that mental illness is
                    encouraged. Sometimes this results in more the one life being taken.
                    <br><br>
                    Some people are crazy. But I think most mass shooters are just are entitled pricks who don’t like something and feel
                    that it is their right to do something about it.
