                <h1>Penrose, Jung, And Consciousness</h1>
                <p><i>Nov 27, 2020</i></p>
                <p>
                    Marvin Minsky was a mathematician and computer scientist who co-founded MIT's CSAIL - Computer Science and Artificial
                    Intelligence Laboratory. He said that the study of consciousness is what people wasted their time on in the 20th
                    century.
                    <br><br>
                    For all of the advances in neurobiology, we seem no closer to solving the mind-brain problem than we were one hundred
                    years ago. Now the study of consciousness is a niche area in neuroscience and sometimes appears in AI research as an
                    exploratory topic. Thankfully Sir Roger Penrose is working diligently on the problem of consciousness.
                    <br><br>
                    Penrose is a physicist famous for his groundbreaking work in general relativity. He helped Stephen Hawking conceptualize
                    black holes and gravitational singularities. He came up with "Twister Theory", which proposed a connection between
                    quantum mechanics and the structure of spacetime. His recent Nobel Prize was for discovering that black hole formations
                    are good predictions for the general theory of relativity. He also spent decades studying consciousness and has put
                    forth a theory with Stuart Hameroff, a medical doctor, on the origin of consciousness called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction" target="_blank">Orchestrated Objective Reduction</a>, or OOR.
                    <br><br>
                    His interest in consciousness began when he was a graduate student at Cambridge. He had learned of Godel's
                    Incompleteness Theorems, which states that there are certain claims in mathematics that cannot be proven. This showed
                    Penrose that whatever is going on in our understanding about consciousness could possibly not be computational. Most
                    scientists regard quantum mechanics irrelevant to our understanding of how the brain works. But as someone who has
                    extensively thought about quantum mechanics, Penrose puts forth a possible connection between it and consciousness. He
                    suggests a deeper level of explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    OOR is a biological theory of mind that states that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons, rather
                    than the conventional view that it's a product of connections between neurons. There is an objective reduction that
                    happens in protein structures known as microtubules, and this reduction goes through a process known as quantum
                    coherence.
                    <br><br>
                    In quantum computing, bits of information can both be "on" and "off" at the same time. The simultaneous existence of
                    both states is called superposition. Quantum coherence happens when a large number of things, let's say a whole system
                    of electrons in the brain, exist together in superposition at once. Objective reduction refers to Penrose's ambitious
                    theory about quantum gravity - how the concept of superposition applies to different spacetime geometries.
                    <br><br>
                    Hameroff suggested to Penrose that microtubules are the quantum device that Penrose had been looking for in his theory.
                    Microtubules help control the strength of synaptic connections in neurons and their shape can protect them from the
                    surrounding noise of the region. They are also symmetric and have a lattice structure. These characteristics are
                    synchronous with how quantum coherence only seems possible in highly protected environments.
                    <br><br>
                    Many neuroscientists believe decisions are caused by neural processes that aren't ruled by conscious thought, suggesting
                    free will to be obsolete. Free will shouldn't be tied to conscious decision making because their relationship is much
                    more nuanced. For instance, we can have the will to drive safely on the highway, but we're largely unconscious of most
                    traffic details. Generally, most neuroscientists find it hard to support the concept of free will. Most scientists grow
                    up believing the universe is determinate. They entered science because they wanted to learn more about the universe and
                    how to better predict it. But quantum theory implies indeterminism. So Penrose might not say that the universe is
                    indeterminate, but he might say that it's determinate and not computable.
                    <br><br>
                    When asked if he believes if there's any inherent meaning in the universe, Penrose said "somehow, our consciousness is
                    the reason the universe is here." This makes complete sense since his theory on quantum gravity and OOR support the
                    concept that superposition can be applied to both spacetime and to neural networks. If that is the case, the universe is
                    indeterminate. There is a strong case for a mover in an indeterminate landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    Penrose's response made me think of Carl Jung's take on consciousness. He wrote in Answer to Job:
                    <br><br>
                    "Existence is only real when it is conscious to somebody. That is why the Creator needs conscious man even though, from
                    sheer unconsciousness, he would like to prevent him from becoming conscious. Whoever knows God has an effect on him."
                    <br><br>
                    Jung strongly believed that man's task is to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious. He
                    coined the phrase "collective unconscious" which refers to the structures of the unconscious mind which are shared among
                    beings of the same species. It's populated by instincts and archetypes, such as the loving mother, the wise old man, the
                    shadow, and the tree of life. As far as he could tell, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the
                    darkness of mere being. Man's destiny is to create more consciousness.
                    <br><br>
                    If Jung read Penrose's Twister Theory and OOR, he might say that the process of creating more consciousness affects the
                    collective unconscious. To Jung, to be in divine service was to be a light in the sea of darkness. Put another way, to
                    be a divine servant is to create more consciousness in the sea of unconsciousness. The process of man becoming conscious
                    of himself enables God to become conscious of his creation. That is a powerful goal, which fits man meaningfully into
                    the scheme of creation, while at the same time conferring meaning upon it.
                    <br><br>
                    If we are to take Jung's view at face value - that we should strive to shine light in the sea of darkness, or create
                    more consciousness in the sea of unconsciousness, and if it's found that the universe is indeterminate and that there is
                    a mover, the next step would be for us to know more about the mover. I don't know if we will ever ever get there. The
                    logical conclusion of the those two ideas imply the end of man's existence. If we shine so much light as to rid of the
                    collective unconscious, man overcomes his instincts and dependency on archetypes. Man becomes God. I don't know if God
                    would've designed a system like that.
