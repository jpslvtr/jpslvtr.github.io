                    Lately, I've been listening to several female friends discuss their relationship problems. Turns out, I have some
                    thoughts on this topic. This post isn't for those of you on a “mission”, for whom a relationship feels like a
                    distraction. I get it, and I respect that. This is for the men who spend their time dating women with no intention of
                    marrying them. So if you are these men, (or just here for the ride), stick around.
                    <br><br>
                    Transitioning from school to work is like entering an unspoken contract where you’re expected to be responsible to a
                    certain degree. As you age, the expectations will grow, nudging you towards contributing to society. While some may opt
                    out of this path, most follow the crowd. Similarly, just as you graduate from school to start a career, it’s natural to
                    evolve from casual dating to seeking a serious, marriage-oriented relationship. I don’t have much evidence to prove this
                    point; only the lived experiences of those around me and a belief that, at some point, this shift makes sense.
                    <br><br>
                    “What if I pick the wrong one?”
                    <br><br>
                    Choosing to date with marriage in mind is precisely about avoiding the mistake of picking the wrong partner. A practical
                    step is to seek the wisdom from happily married men in your circle, asking them what qualities to look for. Your parents
                    can also be valuable resources; they have more life experience, and naturally, they want the best for you. Finding 'the
                    one' isn’t that hard, especially if you have your shit together. I subscribe to a somewhat traditional view that in a
                    relationship, a man should lead. By leading, I mean navigating life together, hand in hand, with you as a guide. A man
                    who is self-aware will find it much easier to support whoever his partner is, paving the way for a more fulfilling
                    marriage.
                    <br><br>
                    “Why not just enjoy a long-term relationship without the label of marriage?”
                    <br><br>
                    Consider this: you’re in a long-term relationship with a woman, and you have children together. If you're hesitant to
                    marry, it’s probably because you want an easy way out, should things go south - avoiding legal and financial hassles. Is
                    this the kind of commitment you want to offer to someone you love? Marriage symbolizes dedication. Think from a child’s
                    perspective: wouldn’t you prefer to see your parents fully committed to each other?
                    <br><br>
                    “Why be monogamous at all?”
                    <br><br>
                    I defer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1cjQDTD_ww" target="_blank">insights from those far wiser than myself</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, marriage was never a priority. I rarely saw examples of good marriages and felt that pursuing my ambitions
                    was incompatible with romantic relationships. However, as I got older, watching my morally right and successful friends
                    getting married made me question my earlier beliefs about marriage. I also made the realization that I probably want
                    children. Isn’t being a father the most (only) meaningful pursuit we can undertake in life?
                    <br><br>
                    This realization flipped a switch in me, steering me towards dating for marriage. Since making that shift, I've found
                    greater happiness, confirming it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
                    <br><br>
                    As an introvert, I valued my bachelor life. Not for the freedom to indulge in pleasures, but for the peace solitude
                    brought me. I thought that marriage would be challenging. And now that I am married, I admit there was an adjustment
                    period to sharing my life so closely with another person. However, this new chapter has become a new norm that only
                    enriches my life. A good spouse is an invaluable gift; being married means having the ultimate supporter, a devoted
                    partner who not only accepts you as you are but also inspires you to grow. Facing life’s challenges becomes a shared
                    journey rather than a solitary battle. That being said, choosing the wrong partner can potentially be very bad,
                    underscoring the importance of making the right choice.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve only been married for like ten minutes. I could be mistaken about some or all of what I’ve said. However, so far,
                    it has held true for me and my friends.
