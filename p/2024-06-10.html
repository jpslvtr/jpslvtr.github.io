                    <b>1. Introduction</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <i>“I don’t quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for
                    the actions I have recently performed. I don’t really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average,
                    reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I can’t recall when it started) I have been a victim of many
                    unusual and irrational thoughts… After my death, I wish that an autopsy would be performed on me to see if there is any
                    visible physical disorder. I have had some tremendous headaches in the past and have consumed two large bottles of
                    Excedrin in the past three months.”<sup>1</sup></i>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Charles Whitman wrote what would effectively become his suicide note the night before he committed the mass murders at
                    the University of Texas tower shooting on August 1, 1966. The excerpt above is from the note. Whitman would kill 14 and
                    wound 31 others the next day before being shot and killed by police. An autopsy showed that Whitman indeed had a tumor
                    in the white matter above his amygdala, a region of the brain associated with emotion regulation and aggression.<sup>2</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Is Whitman an evil person or a victim of biology? If we had a perfect account of what was happening at every synapse in
                    Whitman’s brain, and we learned the difference between what creates a Whitman and not Gandhi, would we consider him
                    unlucky? These are hard questions because they touch on free will, a phrase that has emerged over the past two millennia
                    as the "canonical designator for a significant kind of control over one's actions.”<sup>3</sup> In talking about free will, we have
                    to consider questions about causation, laws of nature, time, the relationship of causal and reasons-based explanations,
                    the nature of motivation, and right and wrong. Even if we get past those questions, there remains the purely empirical
                    question of whether we have free will, and to what extent we have it.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Something we have done as a species quite well is to use logic, and by extension, math and physics, to get closer to
                    answers to hard questions. Newtonian mechanics helped us understand the motion of celestial bodies. General relativity
                    explained the nature of gravity. These are examples of classical physics. Classical physics operates under the
                    assumption that the universe is a well-ordered, predictable system. This leaves little room for an indeterminate idea
                    like free will. But quantum mechanics introduces inherent randomness and suggests that certain events at the microscopic
                    level are fundamentally unpredictable.<sup>4</sup> It breaks the strict causal chain of events implied by classical physics. This
                    indeterminism leaves open a space where not all future events are predetermined, allowing for free will to operate
                    independently of deterministic physical laws. As a curious species, this is an interesting pond to swim in.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    In this paper, I will explain how we should think about free will in the context of physics. The discussion will be
                    grounded in examples of emergence, a phenomenon where higher-level properties arise from the interactions of lower-level
                    components in a system. This paper will start with two examples from the classical world, then focus on free will as an
                    emergent property, and finally discuss the philosophical implications of these findings. All this to make the claim that
                    <b>whether or not one believes in free will depends on how much influence they think quantum mechanics has on the
                    decision-making processes within the brain.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>2. Emergence in Thermodynamics</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Emergence is the phenomenon where larger entities and patterns arise through interactions among smaller entities that
                    themselves do not exhibit such properties. In other words, emergent properties are those that are not present in the
                    individual components but manifest when these components interact at a system level. Both physicists and philosophers
                    have thoughts on emergence. Karen Barad, a physicist, has an idea called agential realism, which states that emergence
                    results through dynamic interactions among parts, where the relationships and exchanges between them create new,
                    higher-level properties. This process is complex and non-linear, involving both material and discursive elements that
                    shape reality and knowledge.<sup>5</sup> Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, highlights the continuous flow of time and the ongoing
                    creative process that leads to the diverse forms of life we see.<sup>6</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    How does this manifest in the real world? One example is thermodynamics. At the fundamental level, thermodynamics is
                    grounded in the behavior of atoms and molecules. But when we observe large collections of these particles, we see
                    emergent properties that are not evident at the microscopic level. Temperature, pressure, and viscosity are examples of
                    such properties. These macroscopic quantities arise from the collective behavior of many particles and can be
                    effectively described without detailed knowledge of each particle's state. The waiter need not know the state of the
                    universe to know what a customer wants to order for dinner; they can just ask. It is important to note that emergent
                    properties in thermodynamics are described deterministically and can be predicted from the deterministic behavior of
                    atoms and molecules, illustrating the concept of weak emergence.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    To be clear, even though emergent properties may be complex, weakly emergent properties can be predicted or simulated
                    based on the underlying micro-level laws, while strongly emergent properties cannot be predicted or derived from the
                    underlying micro-level laws, no matter how much we know about the microscopic details. The examples listed earlier are
                    weakly emergent properties. Some think that consciousness is a strongly emergent property. More on that later.
                    Regardless, the transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic is a cornerstone of thermodynamics, showing how
                    complex behaviors can emerge from simple, fundamental interactions while still being rooted in the deterministic laws
                    governing the behavior of individual particles.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Zooming in, statistical mechanics provides the microscopic foundation for thermodynamics by using statistics to link the
                    behavior of individual particles to the macroscopic properties described by thermodynamic laws. It further proves this
                    concept by providing the bridge between microscopic interactions and macroscopic properties. The distribution of
                    particle velocities in a gas, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, leads to the emergent property of temperature.<sup>7</sup> Pressure arises from the collective impact of countless molecular collisions with the walls of a container.
                    In statistical mechanics, emergence is characterized by the transition from individual particle behavior to collective
                    phenomena that can be described by statistical averages and distributions. This framework allows us to derive
                    macroscopic thermodynamic laws from the underlying microscopic dynamics. The ensemble approach in statistical mechanics
                    treats large numbers of particles as collections, where the exact state of each particle is less important than the
                    overall statistical properties of the system.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Emergence in thermodynamics illustrates how higher-level properties and behaviors can arise from the interactions of
                    simpler elements, with statistical mechanics providing the theoretical foundation for understanding this transition. This interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic realms demonstrates the power of
                    emergent properties and highlights the importance of statistical methods in uncovering the principles governing complex
                    systems.<sup>8</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>3. Computing and Weak Emergence</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Another example is computing. At the fundamental level, computing is based on transistors, logic gates, and binary code.
                    These basic elements interact to give rise to emergent properties like software and artificial intelligence (AI). It can
                    be agreed that there is nothing mysterious about AI, since the underlying components are well understood. As such, here
                    see agential realism in action - emphasizing that the behaviors and capabilities of things like AI emerge from the
                    complex interplay of their underlying components. These properties can be predicted or simulated based on the underlying
                    micro-level laws, demonstrating the principle of weak emergence. The components at the micro-level follow deterministic
                    rules, their interactions lead to the emergence of complex, higher-level functionalities that define modern computing
                    systems. That being said, we can see that the fundamental components and the emergent properties in computing are
                    deterministic. Emergent properties in computing, much like in thermodynamics, arise from simple, deterministic
                    interactions at a fundamental level.

                    <b>4. Conway’s Game of Life</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Before we move on to the mind, let’s make a quick pit stop at the Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life provides a
                    compelling illustration of how simple, deterministic rules can give rise to complex, emergent behaviors. In the Game of
                    Life, a cellular automaton evolves based on a set of straightforward rules governing the birth, survival, and death of
                    cells.

                    But sometimes the interactions among cells lead to the “emergence” of intricate patterns and structures, such as
                    gliders, oscillators, and even self-replicating configurations.
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    This emergence mirrors the phenomena we see in thermodynamics and computing. In thermodynamics, the collective behavior
                    of particles gives rise to macroscopic properties like temperature and pressure, while in computing, the interactions
                    among transistors and logic gates enable the emergence of software and artificial intelligence. The Game of Life
                    demonstrates that complex, higher-level behaviors can emerge from simple, deterministic rules, showcasing the principle
                    of weak emergence. It provides a powerful analogy for understanding how emergent properties in various domains can arise
                    from fundamental, deterministic interactions.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>5. The Mind and Quantum Mechanics</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    When it comes to the mind, addressing emergent properties becomes more complicated. The mind's emergent properties, such
                    as consciousness and free will, are influenced by a complex interplay of both deterministic and indeterministic
                    processes at the fundamental level. Deterministic processes include things in neuroscience, and dynamic networks, or
                    what we call chaos theory. But the indeterministic process of quantum mechanics is also involved.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Neuroscience reveals neurons firing and synapses transmitting signals in a predictable manner based on the brain's
                    structure and previous states.<sup>12</sup> One interesting example is the "hungry judge effect." Studies have shown that judges are
                    more likely to issue harsher sentences before they have had lunch, when they are hungry, and more lenient sentences
                    after eating.<sup>13</sup> This phenomenon actually became the basis for the popular Snickers commercials, 'You're not you when
                    you're hungry.' It is an intriguing yet alarming fact. And chaos theory further highlights the intricate yet
                    deterministic dynamics of neural networks, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different
                    outcomes. But the introduction of quantum mechanics adds an element of indeterminism to the mix. Quantum phenomena such
                    as superposition and entanglement have been proposed to play a role in brain function, potentially influencing neural
                    activity and decision-making processes in a fundamentally unpredictable way.<sup>14</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    The interplay between these deterministic and indeterministic processes at the fundamental level makes it not
                    straightforward to tell whether the emergent properties of the mind, like free will, are purely deterministic. Free will
                    is unlike the previous cases of thermodynamics and computing, where the emergent properties can be fully described and
                    predicted based on the underlying deterministic laws. Just as Heisenberg and Bohr debate the implications of quantum
                    theory in the play Copenhagen, with Heisenberg emphasizing the inherent uncertainty and Bohr stressing the role of the
                    observer, the question of free will in light of quantum mechanics involves grappling with the tension between
                    determinism and indeterminism in the brain.<sup>15</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Let’s revisit the physicist Karen Barad and philosopher Henri Bergson. Barad argues in <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway</i>,
                    that quantum indeterminacy challenges our classical notions of causality and determinism, opening up new possibilities
                    for understanding the nature of agency and free will.<sup>16</sup> The mind's emergent properties, while still exhibiting some level
                    of predictability and describability, are ultimately influenced by the complex interplay of deterministic and
                    indeterministic processes at the fundamental level. Similarly, in <i>Creative Evolution</i>, Bergson talks about the role of
                    indeterminism and novelty in the evolution of life and consciousness. He argues that the élan vital, or vital impetus, introduces an
                    element of unpredictability and creativity into the universe, which cannot be fully captured by mechanistic or
                    deterministic explanations.<sup>17</sup> These thinkers resonate with the idea that the mind's emergent properties, such as free
                    will, may involve a degree of indeterminism arising from quantum phenomena.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Let’s organize our thoughts so far.
                    <figure>

                    <b>6. Philosophical Implications for Free Will</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    What does introducing indeterminism in quantum mechanics mean for our understanding of free will? If quantum
                    indeterminacy influences neural activity and decision-making processes in the brain, it introduces an element of
                    unpredictability, challenging the classical notion of a deterministic universe. While microscopic quantum effects may
                    average out at the macroscopic level, the existence of quantum indeterminacy means that the future is not entirely
                    predictable from the past, even in principle.<sup>18</sup> This leaves open space for free will to operate independently of the
                    deterministic laws of classical physics.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    For example, we can look at the unpredictability arising from the complex interactions of celestial bodies in the <i>Three-Body Problem series</i>, as a metaphor for the emergence of chaotic behavior from deterministic systems.<sup>19</sup> The interplay
                    between deterministic neural processes and indeterministic quantum effects in the brain suggests that free will may
                    involve a nuanced integration of both elements. Just as the characters in the series grapple with the implications of
                    unpredictability for the fate of civilizations, the question of free will in light of quantum mechanics invites us to
                    reconsider our understanding of agency and responsibility.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Despite the indeterminacy introduced by quantum mechanics, Norbert Wiener, computer scientist and philosopher, argues
                    that it does not necessarily provide a more satisfactory explanation for free will than determinism. Wiener acknowledges
                    that quantum mechanics introduces an element of indeterminism, stating that "Tyche [chance] is as relentless a mistress
                    as Ananke [necessity]".<sup>20</sup> In Greek mythology, Ananke represents necessity, inevitability, and determinism, while Tyche
                    represents chance, fortune, and randomness. By equating the two, Wiener emphasizes that both principles are equally
                    powerful and inescapable forces in the universe. He suggests that random events are no more "free" than predetermined
                    ones. This slightly opposing perspective to the former claims that the idea that true free will requires a level of
                    control and rationality that goes beyond mere randomness.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    A common argument in favor of the existence of free will is that you cannot run a society without assigning
                    responsibility. But it has been shown that thoughts, intentions, and actions arise from prior causes beyond conscious
                    control. So what can be made of this? Perhaps believing that individuals are the authors of their actions actually makes
                    them better humans. But how we ought to think about free will is a separate discussion from what is actually happening.
                    From a philosophical perspective, the introduction of indeterminism through quantum mechanics has important implications
                    for the free will debate. Generally, there are three sides to this debate - determinism, compatibilism, and
                    libertarianism. Determinists believe that free will is a complete illusion and that all events are determined by
                    preceding events. Compatibilists believe that free will and determinism are compatible, and that individuals can be free
                    and morally responsible even if their actions are determined by prior causes. Libertarians believe that we have the
                    capacity to make genuinely free choices that are not predetermined by prior events. Most philosophers are
                    compatibilists, some are determinists, and very few are libertarians.<sup>21</sup>

                    Libertarian philosophers, who argue for the existence of free will, may view quantum indeterminacy as providing the
                    necessary break in the causal chain of determinism, allowing for the possibility of genuine free choice. However, as
                    Jenann Ismael and other philosophers have pointed out, indeterminism alone does not necessarily imply free will, as
                    truly random events are no more "free" than deterministic ones.<sup>23</sup> The challenge lies in reconciling the unpredictability
                    of quantum events with the rational decision-making processes associated with free will. Additionally, even in a quantum
                    world, the emergent properties of the mind may exhibit a degree of predictability, as discussed in the context of weak
                    emergence. Striking a balance between the deterministic and indeterministic aspects of the mind remains a key challenge
                    in understanding the nature of free will in light of quantum mechanics. As Bachelard notes in Intuition of the Instant,
                    habit and rational coherence play a crucial role in shaping the mind's emergent properties, suggesting that
                    predictability and continuity can arise even in a discontinuous, indeterministic world.<sup>24</sup>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Wait, so even though quantum indeterminacy introduces randomness into events, this randomness doesn't equate to free
                    will? Unfortunately, yes. Random events, like deterministic ones, are not under our control. True free will requires
                    rational decision-making, which means making choices based on reasons, not just random occurrences. The challenge is to
                    understand how our rational decisions can coexist with the unpredictability of quantum events.

                    <b>7. Conclusion</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    From a classical physics perspective, the deterministic laws governing phenomena like thermodynamics and computing would
                    seem to align free will with a deterministic framework. But quantum mechanics introduces an inherent indeterminism that
                    opens up new possibilities for conceptualizing free will. As articulated by thinkers like Bergson, duration and lived
                    experience inherently involve memory - the coexistence of the present with an ever-accumulating past.<sup>25</sup> If quantum
                    indeterminacy significantly shapes the neural activity underpinning this flow of memory and consciousness, then free
                    will may involve a fundamental element of novelty and unpredictability outside the causal chain of determinism.<sup>26</sup> Yet,
                    even if quantum indeterminacy introduces randomness into events, this randomness doesn't equate to free will. Random
                    events, like deterministic ones, are not under our control.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    If classical deterministic processes largely dominate the brain's biochemical machinery, free will may best be
                    understood through the philosophical lens of compatibilism—as an emergent, higher-level process consistent with (though
                    not necessarily determined by) the underlying deterministic physical laws. The Copenhagen interpretation's
                    acknowledgment of indeterminacy at the quantum scale while upholding determinism at the macro level provides a framework
                    for such a compatibilist perspective. Free will may arise from an integration of deterministic and indeterministic
                    elements that shape reality and knowledge. Rather than an all-or-nothing proposition, free will plausibly involves a
                    nuanced interplay of random and deterministic influences.

                    So, is Charles Whitman an evil person or a victim of biology? From one perspective, if quantum uncertainties critically
                    influenced Whitman's neurological activity, his tragic actions could be seen as stemming in part from an element of
                    fundamental indeterminacy - neither fully deterministic nor fully
                    "free" in the classical sense, but involving a departure from strict causal determinism. Alternatively, if
                    classical deterministic processes governed his brain's compromised biochemical state, his behavior could be viewed as an
                    inevitable outcome of deterministic physical laws, leaving less room for a traditional notion of free will. A similar
                    struggle in ethics is seen in the play Copenhagen, where the characters wrestle with the implications of quantum
                    mechanics for the understanding of human agency and moral responsibility. Ultimately, the extent to which one believes
                    Whitman's tragic choices involved an element of free will likely depends on one's perspective regarding the role of
                    quantum indeterminacy in shaping human consciousness and decision-making, and the philosophical frameworks through which
                    these questions are interpreted, including but not limited to how even randomness does not provide true freedom.
