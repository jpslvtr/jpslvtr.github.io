                    Newtonian physics describes what happens in systems that have large masses and slow speeds. There are three relevant
                    limits that are indicators that Newtonian physics is no longer the preferred model:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Special relativity
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            General relativity
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Quantum mechanics
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    These models are unified. For example, the model of special relativity could be used to solve all solvable
                    problems in physics, but it would just make the calculations unnecessarily difficult. Also, general relativity and
                    quantum mechanics are the two major (but separate) theories for how the universe works. They work well in their own
                    domain, but they are incompatible, especially when gravity is introduced. String Theory has been the only promising
                    candidate of reconciling the two.

                    In Newtonian physics, systems are reversible. Physical processes hold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics)" target="_blank">unitarity</a>, which is the condition that the time
                    evolution of a state is mathematically represented by a unitary operator. Or, if you know everything about a system (like the positions and speeds of all particles), you can use the laws of physics
                    to figure out what it will do in the future. Importantly, you can also reverse the process and figure out what it was
                    doing in the past. This is called reversibility.
                    In this model, there is implicit determinism.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Systems are not as easily reversible in quantum mechanics because of the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic
                    outcome of measurement. Something about it being tricky when the system is moving fast and/or when gravity is introduced... I'm not qualified to go down that rabbit hole. The takeaway is that in Newtonian physics, the world is deterministic, implying
                    there is no freedom vis-a-vis natural laws. But in other more involved models of the universe, the world is not
                    deterministic, implying free will.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Leonard Susskind is a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University and is one of the leading minds in string
                    theory and quantum mechanics. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY#t=782s" target="_blank">Here</a> he talks about the indestructibleness of information. The conservation of the
                    information principle makes sense, but Susskind's explanation and <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/29175/why-is-information-indestructible/72840#72840" target="_blank">this</a> response suggests that the principle is a
                    consequence of unitarity. Is information only relevant in Newtonian physics?
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Noether's theorem is a beautiful fundamental theorem of calculus that connects symmetries to conserved quantities. When
                    physics is independent of spatial position, momentum is conserved. When physics is independent of time, energy is
                    conserved. When you take quantum mechanics into account, Noether's theorem explicitly depends on unitarity. This theorem
                    conserves quantities in nature across every known model of the universe.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    If information is indeed indestructible, it would seem that the conservation of information is caused by the unitarity
                    of the physical process from which the information came from. This is only compatible with Newtonian physics as
                    explained earlier. But I don’t see how this holds true when you consider that information exists on every scale.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    In 1867, Maxwell proposed a thought experiment called Maxwell's demon. If you pour hot liquid into a system of cold
                    liquid, the resultant mix would have an average temperature of both liquids. The only way to stop that would be if there
                    was a small demon there to stop this from happening. Absent this demon, the second law of thermodynamics states that the
                    liquids will mix and reach an average temperature. Leo Szilard, a colleague of Einstein, noted that for the demon to be
                    able to do this, he'd need to have information about which molecules are hot and which molecules are cold. That way he
                    could keep the liquids separated and they wouldn't reach an average temperature. There is just as much
                    information as there is energy in the system.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Information and energy are two sides of the same coin. The laws of thermodynamics express facts about temperature, heat,
                    and entropy from the subatomic to cosmic level. Information exists on these scales as well.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Susskind's belief about the conservation of information implies that information exists in the deterministic landscape
                    underwritten by Newtonian physics. This is clearly not the case. Information exists beyond Newtonian physics if you
                    agree with Szilard, which I do.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Einstein's physics and quantum mechanics support an indeterminate nature of the universe, implying free will. But it
                    seems that our current understanding of the information landscape doesn't support that claim.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    The physics of energy has achieved wonderful feats for
                    mankind. It is governed by mathematical models that describe the universe well independently, but aren’t reconcilable
                    with each other when gravity is introduced. I'm not a physicist, but I suspect that the disconnect has to
                    do with the physics of information. There is so much undiscovered about information creation, symmetry, and measurement.
                    Perhaps when we have clearer models on the physics of information and have revisited our current theories, will we
                    understand more about free will about our place in the universe.
