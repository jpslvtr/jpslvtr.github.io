<h1>In Sync</h1>
<p><i>Jul 15, 2024</i></p>
<p>
I check my phone and it's almost 5am. I decide to fall back asleep, but I can't. My small dog is growl-whining. This means he wants to be petted. So I pet him.
<br><br>
As I pet him, he stops making noises. His sounds transition into breaths - long, soft, but audible. I shift from petting to placing my hand on his heart. My whole hand can cover most of his body. I angle it carefully, not wanting to put too much pressure on his little frame as I fall asleep.
<br><br>
Hopefully, he's satisfied by now. I think he is because all I hear are the sounds of his breath flowing in and out of his nostrils. And his heartbeat. I can feel his heartbeat. His breath and heartbeat are in sync. That makes sense, I think. I'm not a doctor.
<br><br>
We do this routine every day. I live for it.
