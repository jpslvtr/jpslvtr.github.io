                    At some point, I suspect this blog will just be a regurgitation of Cal Newport's own blog and podcast. Until then, it
                    will wander, trying to find my voice.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Today, we return to the deep life. Autumn is here, so school is in session, and those not in school are slowly waking up
                    from their summer nap and preparing to sprint until the holidays. In a recent podcast episode, Cal talks about his "Laws
                    of Less," which is a practical take on his advice on slow productivity. He has long advocated for doing less, and I
                    enjoyed this particular codification.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>1. Accomplishment is non-additive.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Our standing in the professional world is often categorized by what we've done best. We can't add up multiple things at
                    a lower level of quality. I heard M. Night Shyamalan explain on a podcast that many aspects of his life try to take away
                    from what he thinks is the only thing that matters about his job - film writing. The only thing that matters to him and
                    to the rest of the world are the movies he makes, not managing the production logistics, going on press tours, or
                    participating in film festivals. Now, there are examples where one's accomplishments get one in trouble. For instance, if
                    an academic receives a prestigious award like the Nobel Prize, they might think they have license to study aliens. Or someone might try to spread misinformation by citing their credentials. So our goals should focus on making our best work as impactful as possible because that will: a) matter the most in the long run and b) be how people categorize us.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>2. Simultaneity breeds stress.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    If you have multiple projects with deadlines around the same time, it's much harder than if the deadlines were
                    scattered. The stress comes from constantly switching between tasks, missing details, and not having enough time to dive
                    deeply into any single one. To the extent possible, working on one thing at a time before moving onto the next will
                    reduce the cognitive load and allow for deeper engagement with each task. The more intentional you are about your work
                    scheduling, the closer you will come to reducing simultaneous tasks.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>3. Overhead destroys originality.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Coordination, admin, and logistics. One project is manageable, but as the number of projects increases, so does the
                    overhead. Say you’re a professional blogger and for every blog post you need to publish, that requires roughly 10 Zoom
                    calls. If you're working on 3 projects, you'll have 30 Zoom calls. Eventually, all of your
                    time will be spent on Zoom calls, with barely any left for writing.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Get rid of overhead as much as you can. An artist who starts managing a studio can end up spending more time on hiring
                    staff, scheduling, and accounting, than on their creative work. The overhead slowly dilutes the time and mental energy
                    they can dedicate to painting or sculpting. If they hire a manager or assistant to handle logistics, they can stay
                    focused on their creative work. While we don't always have the means to hire an assistant to handle our overhead,
                    something like buying prepared meals or eating out can save time – and I think it's worth it.
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>4. A slower pace is deeply fulfilling.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    In general, humans are happier working on fewer things and spending more time on them. An artist working on a painting
                    or a sculptor working on marble – week after week, month after month – finds deep fulfillment. There's a certain
                    identity associated with being busy and managing lots of hard tasks, but I don't think it hits the human spirit in the same
                    way. An overworked project manager, whose every minute is consumed by one or more meetings—sometimes requiring them to be
                    present in multiple places at once—ends up burnt out rather than fulfilled. So let's work on only a few things. One way you can go slower is by artificially shrinking your calendar. I came across
                    an article by Jeff Weiner, Executive Chairman at LinkedIn, called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130403215758-22330283-the-importance-of-scheduling-nothing/" target="_blank">The Importance of Scheduling Nothing</a>, where he writes:
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    "If you were to see my calendar, you'd probably notice a host of time slots greyed out but with no indication of what's going on. There is no problem with my Outlook or printer. The grey sections reflect "buffers," or time periods I've
                    purposely kept clear of meetings. In aggregate, I schedule between 90 minutes and two hours of these buffers every day (broken down into 30- to 90-minute blocks). It's a system I developed over the last several years in response to a schedule that was becoming so jammed with back-to-back meetings that I had little time left to process what was going on around me or just think. At first, these buffers felt like indulgences. I could have been using the time to catch up on meetings I had pushed out or said "no" to. But over time I realized not only were these breaks important, they were absolutely necessary in order
                    for me to do my job."
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    <b>5. None of this works without discipline.</b>
                    <span class="para-break"></span>
                    Doing one project at a time won't matter if you can't stick to it until its completion. You also need to have the discipline to say no to new things. We want to say yes, but by saying no, we can deliver our best work for the people
                    we've already said yes to.
