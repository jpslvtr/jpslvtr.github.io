                <h1>On Slow Productivity</h1>
                <p><i>Apr 08, 2024</i></p>
                <p> 
                    Life update: I’ve transitioned my blog from Substack to my <a href="https://jpslvtr.com/blog.html" target="_blank">personal site</a>. I was feeling retro.
                    <br><br>
                    For those who are new to my newsletter, I'm a fan of Cal Newport. He's a computer science professor and non-fiction author who began writing student advice as an undergraduate at Dartmouth. He continued his writing throughout his PhD at MIT and even as he worked toward securing tenure at
                    Georgetown, which he did in just six years. His writing transformed from student advice to career advice and now to lifestyle advice.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t particularly like lifestyle advice, but I make an exception for Cal’s. He has never worked past 5:30pm and always respects his weekends. He's a husband, a father, and a devoted member of his community. He doesn’t have a high-octane brain or anything; he is simply committed to doing what’s necessary to lead the life he desires.
                    <br><br>
                    I just finished reading his new book "Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout." Although the topics of his books may seem to have evolved over time, really, the destination has always been the same: living a deep life. If I recall correctly, months ago he was writing "Slow Productivity" alongside a book on the deep life. That book will likely be the culmination of all of his writings. To those who know Cal, this book won't teach you many new ideas. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. We know what the ten commandments are, but we do a good job of pretending like we don't.
                    <br><br>
                    The three main ideas in "Slow Productivity" are:
                    <br>
                    1. Do fewer things.
                    <br>
                    2. Work at a natural pace.
                    <br>
                    3. Obsess over quality.
                    <br><br>
                    The book isn't even about productivity. It's about revisiting your relationship with work. By slowing down, we might not get more tasks done, but we'd get more meaningful work done. This harkens to his <a href="https://calnewport.com/what-the-hell-is-study-hacks/" target="_blank">early student writing</a>, where he talks about doing fewer things, doing them well, and knowing why you're doing them.
                    <br><br>
                    Actively choosing to do fewer things is hard because it requires you to prioritize what's important to you in your life. But if you do that, you're able to do the few things that you do, well. What this means practically is that if you're in college, don't double major, be president of five clubs, and be in a fraternity. Instead, have one major, be in one club, and start to cultivate a meaningful life. In general, fully embrace and advance the small number
                    of projects that matter most.
                    <br><br>
                    When Cal says to work at a natural pace, he's encouraging us to look at the bigger picture. He doesn't care if he has a bad Tuesday. What's more important to him is sticking to his quarterly goals or five-year plan. That means being creative
                    with your work rhythms and embracing seasonality, to the extent that you can. Much of this advice is well suited for writers (the original slow productivity gurus) and freelancers, but there's still a lot that the typical knowledge worker can do to make strides in this area. Take on big projects and plan them over the course of a long time period. Have lofty fitness goals that are set for years, and strike reasonable checkpoints that you can measure over the coming months and years. "If you give yourself more time, it's not just going to be more realistic, it's probably going to be better."
                    <br><br>
                    Obsessing over quality is a throwback to his book "So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love". Strive to produce work of such quality that it will give you the career capital to control more of
                    your work. Your work quality is the glue that holds slow productivity together. "When you go back and study people producing things of real value, using their brain, they were smart and they were dedicated and they worked really hard,
                    but they didn't hustle and they didn't work 10-hour days day after day. They didn't work all-out, year-round. They didn't push, push, push until this thing was done. It was a more natural variation. They had less on their plate at the same time, and they glued it all together by obsessing over quality."
                    <br><br>
                    Who are some of these successful, slow people? The first person he talks about is Jane Austen. Contrary to the myth that Austen wrote in spare moments, she had to deliberately craft her household duties such that she'd have long
                    uninterrupted stretches to focus on her novels. By having fewer responsibilities and protecting her writing time, Austen was able to write multiple masterpieces like "Pride and Prejudice" in just a few years. Another example he brings up is Isaac Newton. His "Principia Mathematica" summed up more than twenty years of Newton's research! And an example that he doesn't talk about in the book but one that I like is J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien's experience fighting in the trenches of WWI inspired his depictions of battle and the struggle between good and evil. He embarked on an academic journey in philology, the study of languages and literature, partly because English mythology and lore didn't have the kinds of moral stories you might find in the Norse, Celtic, Finnish, and Greek traditions. It took Tolkien seventeen years to write "The Lord of the Rings" from start to finish.
                    <br><br>
                    So there you have it. Do less. Do better. While this is much easier said than done, the decision to embrace slow productivity is perhaps one of the most important decisions we can make, paving the way to a deeper and more meaningful life.
