                <h1>Telsa Hertz 100 - DNF</h1>

                <p>
                    I DNF'd Tesla Hertz this past weekend. My foot injury from five weeks ago flared up. Running has been minimal since,
                    with the exception of the <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=76681" target="_blank">12 Hour ATR</a> three weeks ago (19 Sep) where Tamari and I did 34 miles. My pain capped at a 7/10
                    then, so I was hoping this race would be similar.
                    <br><br>
                    We started strong. Other than a handful of climbs and descents, the trail was forgiving. It was a ten mile loop with an
                    aid station every 5 miles. Vinny, the race director, was awesome. The course was well marked. The only challenge was
                    that the loop was sort of dynamic. Runners had to constantly check for trail markings which hindered our ability to zone
                    out - the ultrarunner's secret to running many miles.
                    <br><br>
                    I felt pain in my right foot at around mile 9.5. "You have to be kidding me" I thought. The pain was at a 4-5/10 so I
                    thought I would be fine. I just had to be more cognizant of how my feet landed. I tried to keep my mind occupied, but it
                    was hard because of the dynamic nature of the loop. The pain rose to an 8-9/10 at mile 15.27. The nerves in my foot shot
                    electrifying pain up my leg to my glutes. I said nothing. In fact, the whole time on the course I'm leading a small
                    group - Tamariâ€™s behind me and some straggler was behind her, letting himself zone out. Good strategy.
                    <br><br>
                    I made a decision to Goggins my way through the race. I could do it. I may hurt myself, but I came to run 100 miles. At
                    the mile 25 aid station (almost mile 27 because we had gotten lost on the first loop) I told Tamari "for your
                    situational awareness my foot pain is back and I'm at a 9/10 but I'm going to push through it." She gave me a concerned
                    look but she gets me. We continue running.
                    <br><br>
                    The next five miles were brutal. Maybe it was because I had verbalized my pain and realized how stupid I sounded. Or
                    perhaps it was because I had an actual injury. We were going slow. Walking didn't help; the pain was at the same level.
                    Why didn't I better monitor my mileage increase over the summer? Why didn't I roll my feet on my lacrosse ball more
                    regularly?
                    <br><br>
                    I dropped from the race.
                    <br><br>
                    I hated that I had to make that choice. I hated that I felt so physically prepared to run 100 miles, but an injury was
                    preventing me. I hated that I knew I could white-knuckle my way through it but doing so could possibly give me a
                    sustained injury.
                    <br><br>
                    I told Vinny I was done. I talked with Tori on the phone and she helped process some emotions. I went back to the
                    airbnb, showered, ate, and went to a nearby park. I talked with my mom on the phone and she helped me process even more.
                    Tamari <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=74666" target="_blank">completed the race</a>. I was so happy for her. I picked her up Sunday morning and hyped her up. No one gets why we
                    do ultras besides other ultrarunners. I knew exactly how proud she was of herself. I made sure she knew that I knew it.
                    Our drive back down was tiring for me, but she deserved to be showered with praise. She did something amazing.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent some time Monday reflecting. I don't think I'm done reflecting yet. My first reaction was thinking I was going
                    to run 100 miles next weekend. Upon realizing how stupid that was, I planned to run it in two weekends. In a month. In
                    December.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't need to prove to anyone that I can run 100 miles a second time, but this is my first DNF.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm going to prioritize taking care of my body. It will take time but I'm patient. I can watch grass grow. Almost every
                    version of my best self has been birthed from setback and spite. I'm going to train smarter. I'm going to get faster.
                    I'm going to become a stronger ultrarunner.
