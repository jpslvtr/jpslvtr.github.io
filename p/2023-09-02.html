                <h1>Unearthing Secrets: Navigating Life's Contradictions</h1>
                <p><i>Sep 02, 2023</i></p>
                <p>
                    Peter Thiel’s legendary interview question is, “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” The
                    motivation behind this question is that Thiel believes that the most successful companies are based on secrets. They
                    solve a problem that others didn’t even know was prevalent until it was solved. This frame of thinking about secrets was
                    inspired by one of Thiel’s late Stanford professors, René Girard, who claimed that the world is filled with important
                    but undiscovered truths.
                    <br><br>
                    I love this question because it forces you to cut through nonsense and look for the ground truth. The problem, however,
                    is that it’s very hard to establish what is true. But at least it’s an exercise in critical thinking and honesty.
                    <br><br>
                    I think that in many cases, the step immediately preceding the one where you arrive at a secret is unraveling a
                    contradiction. It’s hard to learn secrets. They are not immediately apparent to us. But when we dive deep - when we keep
                    asking why - we might uncover inconsistencies that were previously hidden. Paradoxes that prompt us to challenge our
                    initial assumptions.
                    <br><br>
                    The thing is, I see too many of these contradictions. And I’m not sure what secrets they reveal, other than the idea
                    that contradictions are a part of life.
                    <br><br>
                    An area ripe with these contradictions is reckoning immediate desires with long-term goals. We rightly pay heart
                    surgeons a lot of money to do the craft they spent decades perfecting - saving lives. But if we really wanted to live
                    healthily until our hearts naturally expired, we wouldn’t exactly need heart surgeons. We would be much more interested
                    in eating right and exercising regularly. But we aren’t interested in doing either of those things because they are in
                    opposition to the dopamine that comes from ordering junk food and having it delivered to our doorsteps. So therein lies
                    the problem.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m sympathetic to this problem because being in touch with our immediate desires is also important. Otherwise, we would
                    be no different from robots. Okay, so how do we get closer to the long-term goal of living healthily? Well, it would
                    certainly make things easier if our immediate desires weren’t so readily fulfilled. So we stop eating sugar. No, but
                    that’s not possible. Economies have been built and people's livelihoods depend on the fact that we are willing to pay a
                    premium for dopamine. So… let’s try to get others to help us do the things we’re supposed to do to combat our immediate
                    desires. Let’s invest in grade school P.E. curriculums. Let’s pay dietitians more and let’s have more of them. But we
                    don’t do these things. Why? Who knows.
                    <br><br>
                    Another area filled with contradictions is the push and pull of our values. For example, courage is one of our oldest
                    virtues, yet our many of us are here today by way of our ancestors choosing not to die in battle. We come from a line of
                    cowards that claim to value courage. This is an oversimplification, but it illustrates my point. An even more egregious
                    contradiction in values is the problem medieval culture ran into when trying to square chivalry with Christianity.
                    Chivalry was a code of conduct that knights were expected to follow, emphasizing virtues like loyalty and protection of
                    the weak. It often involved the idea of defending the vulnerable and upholding honor, which could mean going into
                    battle, protecting women, and showing generosity. Christianity, on the other hand, teaches values such as humility,
                    compassion, and turning the other cheek, which might sometimes conflict with the more aggressive and honor-driven
                    aspects of chivalry. Participating in combat, even for honorable reasons, could involve violence that contradicted the
                    message of peace and forgiveness promoted by Christianity.
                    <br><br>
                    The last example I’ll mention might be a touchy subject - the clash of equality and liberty. Our species has gone
                    through a lot of political and social reformation in the last few centuries, and we have come to see both social
                    equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. However, these two values are in gross conflict with each other.
                    Equality often requires restricting the freedoms of those who possess greater advantages. While ensuring the freedom of
                    every individual to act according to their desires inherently compromises the goal of equality. The history of the last
                    few hundred years can be interpreted as a succession of efforts to resolve this inherent contradiction.
                    <br><br>
                    So yeah. I’m not sure what secrets I’m close to uncovering, much less what money there is to be made based on these
                    secrets. But hey, I could probably have a fruitful conversation with Peter Thiel.
