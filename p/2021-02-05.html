                    In the late 1800s Nietzsche foresaw that hundreds of millions of people would die in the 20th century. They would die
                    because of the replacement of religion with this rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world. Nietzsche
                    wasn't attempting to be prophetic; he was diagnosing a shift in the nature of moral authority and describing the effects
                    this shift would have. Effects such as the unending oscillation between nihilism and numbing of the mind.
                    <br><br>
                    The Scientific Revolution ignited the match that led to the fiery secularization of society. That was when we decided it
                    was okay to chop off the legs of the chairs we sat on because we thought all we needed were the seats. This was what I
                    believe to be a fruitful catastrophe. Fueled by the movement of modernism, we've become overwhelmed with the complexity
                    of life, tortured by its seemingly callous nature, and unsure of reasons to continue with our own. Our rational
                    intellect has become divorced from our being. Divorced so much so that we begin to question ourselves.
                    <br><br>
                    Two questions that address our place in reality are
                    <br><br>
                    1. What is the world made of?
                    <br><br>
                    2. How should we live in the world?
                    <br><br>
                    Both questions are equally important but we've become so focused on the first question that we've ignored the second.
                    Those who are adamant critics of religion seem to believe that if we abandon spirituality, we would all instantly become
                    rational, untroubled thinkers like Descartes or Bacon. I don't think thatâ€™s true. I believe that secularization has
                    brought upon irrationalities that make it difficult for us to live in the world. People have replaced religion with
                    ideologies. Ideologies are like crippled religions. Group identity provides a certain amount of security that is warped
                    and twisted. It's a parasite on something underlying that is rich and true.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a God-shaped hole in the human heart. What has resulted from abandoning religion are irrationalities so severe
                    that even the deepest, strangest mysteries of the Christian faith seem positively rational by contrast. "The Bible in a
                    Year" podcast by Fr. Mike Schmitz has been ranked #1 on Apple Podcasts through January 2021 and is #3 at the time of me
                    writing this post. People are now seeing that there may be fundamental truths. Truths that have been revealed to us in
                    the Christian scriptures. We've needed God for quite some time. And now we may be witnessing the dawn of a new revival.
