                    Riffle Ford Aid Station, mile 42. A volunteer asked me if I needed anything. I tried to focus my mind enough to form sentences. “Could you… gatorade… please?”, as I pointed to the bottles strapped to my chest. I then proceeded to the
                    table of snacks. I downed some PB&J’s. When the same volunteer came back with my gatorade he looked at me and said "son your eyes are blood shot”. Hm. Did I pop a blood vessel? I told him I was fine.
                    <br><br>
                    I was not fine. Apparently I slurred my words. He gave me a salt tablet and asked me to sit down. I ignored him. I felt focused. Eight miles to go. I was going to finish strong.
                    <br><br>
                    The 2019 Stone Mill 50 was my first 50 mile ultramarathon. The only other ultra I had done prior was a 50 km road race in 2016.
                    <br><br>
                    I was... unprepared for the fifty miler. The longest training session I did was back-to-back long runs two weeks prior, 25 miles Saturday and 10 miles Sunday. I should've gotten a lot more time on trails. I also should've invested in trail
                    gear. Nothing fancy, but at least trail shoes. I thought my road shoes would've been fine but about thirty minutes into the race I realized how valuable proper footwear would've been.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a brisk twenty-two degrees at the start of the race. I kept up with the lead group for about an hour. Big mistake. I winded myself out, so I had to slow down. And for the first two hours of the race my feet/lower legs were swollen. I’m still not sure why this happened.
                    <br><br>
                    My legs eventually evened out, but in the process, I had running on numb legs. I couldn't gauge how damaged my feet were from all the pounding from the trail. Once my feet got back their feeling, I realized they were pretty screwed up.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultramarathons are long. A lot can change. I wanted to quit after the first two hours. Everything sucked. I was cold, scraped, my feet were messed up, and my socks were muddy. Fortunately I met a woman about my mom's age and paced with her for a few hours. She was a seasoned ultrarunner, having done several ranging from 50 km’s to 100 milers. This was
                    her sixth time running this race. She was awesome to pace with and gave me good advice. I kept up with her for a while, but alas she was too fast.
                    <br><br>
                    The rest of the race was a mix of talking to myself and running with random groups of people. I ran with the same two runners from around mile 38 and on. They were both moms from Virginia. Not sure what is about me and older women. They
                    were great company. One especially had a very positive attitude. Having them with me really saved me in the last part of
                    the race.
                    <br><br>
                    This race was the hardest continuous thing I've ever done. I finished in around thirteen hours. Triathlons are different in that you can go all out in each leg of the race. During ultras, you're using your legs 100% of the time.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t like running. I think most people would rather sit in the comfort of their own home and watch TV. My willpower is especially tested now in the cold, when my alarm goes off in the morning and it’s freezing outside. So why do I run?
                    <br><br>
                    Spite.
                    <br><br>
                    In the fall of 2011 I tried out for my high school’s cross country team. Well, you tried out for varsity and if you didn’t make it, there was a spot for you on JV. I remember struggling through try-outs and the first few practices. I
                    had never been a runner and endurance was not my forte. One day, the assistant coach took me aside after we got off the bus and told me that running wasn’t for everyone. I nodded and quit the next day. When asked by my parents and friends,
                    I told them I just didn’t like running. But the coach’s words were tattooed to my memory. I had a rage inside of me. I hated that my endurance was a handicap. From that moment on, I was going to get better at running.
                    <br><br>
                    Time and space to clear my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve tried meditation where I sit cross-legged. But it’s hard for me to sustain a regular practice. Over the years I have found running to be therapeutic and eventually realized that it serves as meditation. It wasn’t straightforward,
                    but now I have another reason to run. It’s daily, uninterrupted time I have to clear my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    Self-improvement.
                    <br><br>
                    I think that running, or endurance sports in general, is the most no-frills path to self-improvement. I learned so much about myself in the thirteen hours I raced that day. I faced demons I didn’t know I had. I came to resolutions on problems that were occupying the back of my mind. I laughed, cried, hated, and loved myself. I learned more about myself in half a day than I might have learned in ten years of living like a zombie.
                    <br><br>
                    Feeling human.
                    <br><br>
                    I think many ultrarunners share the sentiment that life is getting too comfortable. We’ve got cars with heated seats and refrigerators stocked full of food. I enjoy these things, but this level of comfort is new to us. There is something
                    special about barely moving forward at mile 42. You're tired, hungry, mad, hurting - but you’ve also never been more in touch with your body. You feel close to death, yet you've never felt more alive.
                    <br><br>
                    The community.
                    <br><br>
                    It makes me proud to be a human every time I meet these insanely resilient humans at races. These people live normal lives, yet run like our hunter-gatherer ancestors. It feels amazing to be surrounded by these warriors.
