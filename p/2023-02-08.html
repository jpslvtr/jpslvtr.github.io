                <h1>Bottom-Up VS Top-Down Reality</h1>
                <p><i>Feb 08, 2023</i></p>
                <p>
                    I recently watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film)" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> for the first time. It was a captivating journey in search of answers to profound
                    existential questions: Where do we come from, and why are we here?
                    <br><br>
                    One particular scene stood out to me, where a crew member was having a conversation with David, an android played by
                    Michael Fassbender.
                    <br><br>
                    David asked “why do you think your people made me?”
                    <br><br>
                    The crew member says “we made you because we could.”
                    <br><br>
                    After a pause, David responds “can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing from your
                    creator?”
                    <br><br>
                    I also recently read Douglas Hofstadter’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach" target="_blank">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>, a Pulitzer Prize winning book that talks about
                    consciousness with an interdisciplinary lens. I may have skipped a few chapters… it’s quite long. Any attempt at a
                    review from me would do the book injustice, so I’ll only talk about a few key points that resonated with me.
                    <br><br>
                    Hofstadter asks, how do we get a self from a bunch of meaningless primitives like atoms and molecules? The issue with
                    defining the self, or “I”, is that at its core, the problem is self-referential. We perceive the world around us but we
                    also perceive ourselves. We perceive ourselves perceiving, and this somehow gives rise to the self. We are recursively
                    confirming “I” with ourselves. It’s a paradox.
                    <br><br>
                    It turns out that there are similar self-referential paradoxes in mathematics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems</a>. We
                    know that <a href="https://homepages.uc.edu/~martinj/Philosophy%20and%20Religion/Mystical%20&%20Anti-Philosophical%20Texts/Consciousness/Reduction%20of%20Arithmetic%20to%20Logic%20and%20Set%20Theory.pdf" target="_blank">mathematics can be reduced</a> to a bunch of arbitrary symbols and operations. And mathematicians have rigorously
                    proven how we go from those arbitrary symbols and operations to something that could refer to itself. Hofstadter’s claim
                    is that this mathematical relationship is equivalent to the relationship between atoms and molecules and the “I”.
                    <br><br>
                    According to Hofstadter, a “strange loop” arises when one moves up or down in a system, but inevitably find themselves
                    back where they started.
                    The premise of the book is that the two processes are related. What’s interesting is that the idea that small things
                    give rise to the self is similar to David Chalmers’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" target="_blank">easy-vs-hard problem of consciousness</a>. Chalmers asks, how do
                    physical processes within the brain give rise to a subjective experience? Here, physical processes correspond to
                    problems that would be “easy” to solve, where easy means probable given continued progress in technology.
                    <br><br>
                    Hofstadter and Chalmers both start at a similar place. They assume that consciousness could be bottom-up. This was the
                    thought that lit up in my brain while watching Prometheus where the crew member told David “we made you because we
                    could.” David was created not for a noble purpose, but because humans were bored.
                    <br><br>
                    The idea that everything has a reason comes from rejecting the possibility that things in life could be bottom-up, or
                    that they just happen. Instead, we tend to believe that life is top-down, or that there is downward causality at every
                    level. We think that we are in charge of our actions and that God is in charge of ours. Only after a thought arises, do
                    our actions follow.
                    <br><br>
                    There’s nothing wrong with thinking this way. It is just as reasonable to think that our lives have purpose or that our
                    lives have no purpose. The problem arises when our all or nothing mentality says that everything is bottom-up or
                    everything is top-down. If everything is bottom-up, nothing matters. There’s no plan. Consciousness happened by accident
                    and we exist just because. If everything is top-down, then every single atom has a purpose. Our souls inhabit temporary
                    corporeal skin suits, and we are to fulfill what God has in store for us.
                    <br><br>
                    My suggestion is that we should push aside this all or nothing mentality and consider that randomness and deliberate
                    acts can exist in the same universe.
                    <br><br>
                    Why consider bottom-up? Besides the fact that Hofstadter has a strong claim for the connection between Gödel and the
                    self, it beautifully describes what’s going on inside of our brains. Our brains selectively process information, because
                    to absorb everything would be overwhelming. Selective information is passed and triggers concepts in our brain that link
                    to other concepts. To perceive a playground for the 1,000th time triggers concepts like play, friends, and swing. Over a
                    lifetime of forming concepts, the most complex concept that is formed is the self. Hofstadter argues that consciousness
                    can be reduced to a bunch of squirting chemicals. But since our feeble brains can’t read that level of finesse, we jump
                    up several levels. An individual neuron has no meaning. But grouped together, it gives rise to the self.
                    <br><br>
                    Remember when I wrote that mathematics can be reduced to a bunch of meaningless symbols? Consciousness should also be
                    able to be reduced to smaller things. <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/about/shannon#:~:text=The%20American%20mathematician%20and%20computer,that%20now%20lace%20the%20earth." target="_blank">Claude Shannon</a> showed us that we could apply logic (Boolean algebra) to the design
                    of relay switching circuits, kickstarting the world of information. He showed us that any kind of content, whether it be
                    text or images, could be converted into a string of binary digits, or bits.
                    <br><br>
                    In turn, consciousness should also be able to be reduced to bits. Or anything binary. It could be yes soda-can and no
                    soda-can. You just need enough of them arranged in the right pattern and they can do what our neurons can do.
                    <br><br>
                    Why be wary of top-down? There’s nothing wrong with believing that we author of our own life story. The problem arises
                    when we attribute everything to intent. Someone cuts us off in traffic and we immediately think that they did it on
                    purpose. We look at homelessness and blame the state for lack of secure funding. We attribute our successes to God and
                    our failures to someone else.
                    <br><br>
                    I think this is the reason why we disagree so often. For example, two administrations have led our country in navigating
                    the COVID pandemic. We’ve been quick to attribute successes and failures to each administration, when in reality, most
                    of COVID was unprecedented so everyone was making shit up. I’m not saying everything is emergent, but a whole lot more
                    is emergent than we give credit to.
                    <br><br>
                    Consciousness has been a hot topic of conversation since the days of Socrates and the Buddha, but it’s still not clear
                    how it arises. And even if it was made clear, the debate wouldn’t end. In the face of facts, we’re governed by our
                    feelings. As long as we believe that the “I” is in charge, we’ll believe that whatever feels real, is real.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t have an answer. Yes, maybe you did just waste ten minutes of your life by reading this post. I’ll leave you with
                    something from Hofstadter that has given me some reassurance:
                    <br><br>
                    “We human beings… are unpredictable self-writing poems - vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly
                    beautiful.”
