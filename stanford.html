                Some of my favorite classes at Stanford (in roughly the order I took them):
                <br><br>
                MKTG 535 Product Launch: Essential for aspiring entrepreneurs. The class was intense, with lots of cold-calling, but
                incredibly insightful. Each case discussion had founders or investors from the case come speak with the class. One of
                the few classes where I felt compelled to take real notes.
                <br><br>
                CS 224G Apps With LLMs Inside: A hands-on, project-based class with little admin. Taught by two serial founders who are
                also Stanford CS PhDs, the course focused on learning the latest tech and practical implementation. I was fortunate to
                be part of its inaugural cohort.
                <br><br>
                CEE 216 Entrepreneurship Through the Lens of Venture Capital: Weekly seminars featuring founders and VCs, including
                Jerry Yang (Yahoo), Mark Pincus (Zynga), and Eddie Kim (Gusto). A mix of grad students and undergrads made for great
                conversation.
                <br><br>
                POLECON 549 The Business World - Moral & Spiritual Inquiry Through Literature: We basically read a book each week and
                had deep discussions on them. Scotty McLennan is the only GSB professor who dares to talk about spirituality. I can't
                speak for every student, but I definitely appreciate him for it.
                <br><br>
                APPPHYS 363 Modern Physics & Literature: A hidden gem of a class that is jointly taught by the Physics & English
                departments. Topics included time, causality, higher dimensions, and quantum ontology. Read works by Rovelli, Bergson,
                Ken Liu, and Liu Cixin, including <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> series. Physics PhDs in the class helped the rest of us
                follow along.
                <br><br>
                GSBGEN 312 I'm Just a Bil: A notorious GSB class known for being controversial and challenging, taught by Keith
                Hennessey, former Director of the National Economic Council. It was essentially a legislative simulation. The most
                demanding class I’ve taken but also the one I learned the most from.
                <br><br>
                GSBGEN 346 Freedom, Democracy, and Capitalism: Another one from Keith Hennessey. I think his goal is to reduce the
                number of morally inept business leaders the GSB produces. No one else challenges us to think as critically about the
                world as he does.
                <br><br>
                STRAMGT 354 Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital: A popular GSB class that usually requires a "super round" - using one
                of your two golden ticket cards for high-demand electives - to enroll. The course was mostly guest lectures and a
                business plan competition with a team. Being taught by Scott Kupor (author of <i>Secrets of Sand Hill Road</i>, a reason
                in my decision to attend business school) and Eric Schmidt was a huge privilege. We had many incredible founder and
                investor guests. It’s one of those classes that made sitting in the classroom feel surreal.
