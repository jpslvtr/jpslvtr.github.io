                <a href="https://github.com/jpslvtr/syndicate/" target="_blank">Syndicate</a> is a private newsletter
                platform that allows individuals to share intimate and controlled updates with specific groups of
                friends. I worked on it during a weekend when inspiration struck. The codebase is a mess, and I haven't worked on it much since then, but I plan to further develop it and launch it sometime in summer 2024.

                I created a granular <a href="https://jpslvtr.com/weather-forecast/" target="_blank">weather forecast</a> to plan my running sessions. It provides information on the temperature, likelihood of precipitation, and wind speed. This tool now saves me the time previously spent waiting for weather.com and accuweather.com to load. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who uses it.
